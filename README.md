## Description

Pixel Post is a neat, little application that is designed for people who enjoy creating Pixel Art. Pixel Post has a custom built, React rendered, canvas that allows you to create Pixel Art on a canvas as large or as small as youâ€™d like. Each Pixel is its own React render HTML element, that you can alter the colour of using the wonderful colour palette. These pixels get sorted into Rows based upon your desired Canvas parameters. You can access the canvas without creating an account and quickly download your drawings for sharing, or you can signup and login to access your own personal Gallery where you can put your creations for safekeeping and future sharing.
